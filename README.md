This project is to complete my next step in The Odin Project's foundations path.
The goal is to make a simple website that displays a list of recipes, with each recipe occupying its own page.
At the end of this project I will have demonstrated the following skills:
    A basic understanding of HTML boilerplates, headers, paragraphs, links, and images.
    An understanding of relative links.
    A basic understanding of the Git commit workflow.
